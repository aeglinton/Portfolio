            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Andrea Eglinton. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Minnesota in the MGIS program. I have my Bachelors degree in Geology from Gustavus Adolphus College.</p>
            
            <p>I grew up in Minnesota and spent much of my time outdoors. This included countless camping trips with my family as well as running around town with the Cross Country and Track teams.</p>

            <p>Since graduating in 2012 I spent time volunteering for the Conservation Corps of MN and working for the Natural Resources Conservation Service. I am currently employed through the University of Minnesota as a Graduate Assistant and a Teaching Assistant.</p>

            <p>I have held different jobs while at school, but I am looking for a career once I graduate. I enjoy pretty much every aspect of GIS, but I want a career in the development field. I loving programming and want to do it for the rest of my life!</p>

            <p>Please feel free to download my resume for additional information and contact me with any questions you may have!</p>
